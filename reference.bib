  abstract = {The evolutionary origin of metazoan cell types such as neurons and muscles is not known. Using whole-body single-cell RNA sequencing in a sponge, an animal without nervous system and musculature, we identified 18 distinct cell types. These include nitric oxide--sensitive contractile pinacocytes, amoeboid phagocytes, and secretory neuroid cells that reside in close contact with digestive choanocytes that express scaffolding and receptor proteins. Visualizing neuroid cells by correlative x-ray and electron microscopy revealed secretory vesicles and cellular projections enwrapping choanocyte microvilli and cilia. Our data show a communication system that is organized around sponge digestive chambers, using conserved modules that became incorporated into the pre- and postsynapse in the nervous systems of other animals.},

  abstract = {Mangroves have colonised extreme intertidal environments characterised by high salinity, hypoxia and other abiotic stresses. Aegiceras corniculatum, a pioneer mangrove species that has evolved two specialised adaptive traits (salt secretion and crypto-vivipary) is an attractive ecological model to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation to intertidal environments. We assembled de novo a high-quality reference genome of A. corniculatum and performed comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation to intertidal environments. We provide evidence that A. corniculatum experienced a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event c. 35 Ma. We infer that maintenance of cellular environmental homeostasis is an important adaptive process in A. corniculatum. The 14-3-3 and H+-ATPase protein-coding genes, essential for the salt homeostasis, were preferentially retained after the recent WGD event. Using comparative transcriptomics, we show that genes upregulated under high-salt conditions are involved in salt transport and ROS scavenging. We also found that all homologues of DELAY OF GERMINATION1 (DOG1) had lost their heme-binding ability in A. corniculatum, and that this may contribute to crypto-vivipary. Our study provides insight into the genomic correlates of phenotypic adaptation to intertidal environments. This could contribute not only within the genomics community, but also to the field of plant evolution.},
